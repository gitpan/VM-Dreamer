Dreamer itself relies only on Perl. The test-suite relies on Test::More
which should be included with most modern Perl distributions.

To install Dreamer from CPAN, you just need to type:

   # cpan VM::Dreamer

Installing manually is also fairly simple.

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test
   # make install

If you want to clean up

   $ make clean

Note: you may need to issue the # commands as root or sudo.
