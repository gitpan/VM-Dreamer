Welcome to Dreamer!

NOTE: THIS IS A PRE-RELEASE VERSION. ANYTHING IS SUBJECT
TO CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND THE 1.0 RELEASE.

Dreamer is a framework to emulate arbitrary one-operand
computers. This means that Dreamer lets you define simple
computers and then execute machine code for them.

To understand how to use Dreamer, download the tarball
and look in the 'examples' folder. There's a pre-defined
machine called grasshopper and some pre-written programs
for it.

Assuming you've installed Dreamer, you can execute them
via:

    $ cd examples/grasshopper
    $ perl grasshopper.pl sample_code/io

Also, Dreamer is extensively documented. If anything
isn't clear or you find something missing (or if you
have any feedback in general), please email me.

Thanks,
