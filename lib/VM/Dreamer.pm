Dreamer - A framework to emulate arbitrary one-operand computers

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use VM::Dreamer qw{ initialize_machine load_program get_next_instruction increment_counter };
use VM::Dreamer::Languages::MyComputer qw{ get_definition execute_next_instruction };

my $definition = get_definition();
my $machine    = initialize_machine($definition);

my $program = '/path/to/my/program'; 

load_program( $machine, $program );

until( $machine->halt ) {
    get_next_instruction($machine);
    increment_counter($machine);
    execute_instruction($machine);
}

exit 0;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 initialize_machine

Takes two hash_refs as input and returns a pointer to a machine. The first input is the machine's definition and the second is it's instruction set.

Usually, the definition is received from get_definition and the instruction set is from VM::Dreamer::Languages::MyMachine::get_instruction_set

=head2 load_program

Takes a reference to your machine and a path to a program for your machine. If the file cannot be opened or is not valid, it raises an exception. Otherwise it puts the instructions into the corresponding addresses in your machine's memory and returns 0.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dreamer is a framework to emulate arbitrary 1-operand computers. It comes with pre-defined machines, but also lets you define and operate your own. It was written as a generalization of the Little Man Computer to help myself and others understand the foundations of Computer Science.

=head1 GETTING STARTED 

The easiest way to get started is to execute a pre-written program for a pre-defined machine. This is as simple as:

    $ grasshopper sample_code/grasshopper/io

It will just ask you for a number and then give it back.

After you do that, I would try writing your own program for Grasshopper. It comes with a well-written tutorial.

From there, you could move on to writing programs for Eagle or you could start defining your own machine and writing code for it.

=head2 Defining your own machine

This is explained extensively in VM::Dreamer::Tutorial::MachineDefinition. If you'd rather learn by example, the one for Grasshopper should be a good example - see VM::Dreamer::Languages::Grasshopper.

=head2 Developing the code base

If you really get into this and you'd like to work on the code base, please let me know:

=head1 NEXT STEPS


You can also find the documenation on defining your own machines. Then you can start writing your own programs for it. If you really get bored, you can write an assembler. If that isn't enough you can create a higher level language and write a compiler for your instruction set. Really, the sky's the limit ;-)

I also thought that these simple machines could be of mathematical interest in the sense that they can operate on very, very large numbers in a relatively arbitrary base (though you could probably already do this with bc).

They might also be intersting to people who want to translate machine code from one machine to another or to target multiple platforms from a generic assembly code like UNCOL.

Enjoy!
